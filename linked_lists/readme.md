How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?

`2.2.rb`: Implement an algorithm to find the nth to last element of a singly linked list.

`2.3.rb`: Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a single linked list, given
only access to that node.

`2.4.rb`: You have two numbers represented by a linked list, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in reverse order, such that the 1â€™s digit is at the head of
the list. Write a function that adds the two numbers and returns the sum as a linked
list.

`2.5.rb`: Given a circular linked list, implement an algorithm which returns node at the beginning of the loop.
