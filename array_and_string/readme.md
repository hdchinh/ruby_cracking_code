# Array and String chapter.

`1.1.rb`: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if
you can not use additional data structures?

`1.2.rb`: Write code to reverse a C-Style String. (C-String means that “abcd” is represented as
five characters, including the null character.)

`1.3.rb`: Design an algorithm and write code to remove the duplicate characters in a string
without using any additional buffer. NOTE: One or two additional variables are fine.
An extra copy of the array is not.

`1.4.rb`: Write a method to decide if two strings are anagrams or not.

`1.5.rb`: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with ‘%20’.
